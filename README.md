Get in touch if you'd like help

## Bryntum

The app uses a trial version of the Bryntum schedule. To install it, you may need to register at bryntum. See https://www.bryntum.com/products/scheduler/docs/#Grid/guides/npm-repository.md#repository-access

If you are implementing this into a production app, you will obviously need to get access to the paid version.
